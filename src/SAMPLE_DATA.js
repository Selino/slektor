        description:
          "Confronting and solving problems is a painful process which most of us attempt to avoid. Avoiding resolution results in greater pain and an inability to grow both mentally and spiritually. Drawing heavily on his own professional experience, Dr M. Scott Peck, a psychiatrist, suggests ways in which facing our difficulties - and suffering through the changes - can enable us to reach a higher level of self-understanding. He discusses the nature of loving relationships: how to distinguish dependency from love; how to become one's own person and how to be a more sensitive parent. This is a book that can show you how to embrace reality and yet achieve serenity and a richer existence. Hugely influential, it has now sold over ten million copies - and has changed many people's lives round the globe. It may change yours.",

          "Robert John Meehan's poetic insight into the heart and soul of both teacher and student tugs at readers' emotions like few writers can. His depth of experience as a teacher in some of the nation's most difficult schools over a period of four decades is deeply embedded in each of his selections of poetry. His ability to share the joy, sorrows, and at times, the horror of teaching in today's inner city schools is brought to the forefront in each of the poems included in his The Teacher's Journey. Meehan has accomplished much over the past decades in encouraging other teachers to share their feelings, emotions, and experiences in working with students. Follow Meehan as he inspires students and teachers alike in The Teacher's Journey to understanding the meaning of being an authentically effective teacher.",

          "A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth",
        authors: ["M. Scott Peck"],

        description:
          "Now featuring a new introduction by Dr. M. Scott Peck, the twenty-fifth anniversary edition of the classic bestseller The Road Less Traveled, celebrated by The Washington Post as “not just a book but a spontaneous act of generosity.” Perhaps no book in this generation has had a more profound impact on our intellectual and spiritual lives than The Road Less Traveled. With sales of more than seven million copies in the United States and Canada, and translations into more than twenty-three languages, it has made publishing history, with more than ten years on the New York Times bestseller list. Written in a voice that is timeless in its message of understanding, The Road Less Traveled continues to help us explore the very nature of loving relationships and leads us toward a new serenity and fullness of life. It helps us learn how to distinguish dependency from love; how to become a more sensitive parent; and ultimately how to become one’s own true self. Recognizing that, as in the famous opening line of his book, “Life is difficult” and that the journey to spiritual growth is a long one, Dr. Peck never bullies his readers, but rather guides them gently through the hard and often painful process of change toward a higher level of self-understanding.",

        description:
          'A horn is an instrument either for protection or destruction. The "horn" in the Horn of Africa has for so long turned inward, and on its people, thus victimizing those it was supposed to defend. The ensuing internecine bloodletting has thrown the region into an abyss out of which it is still struggling to emerge. Much of the story of this abyss is captured in social, political, economic, and literary treatises written by indigenous and international experts. Rarely, however, has there been a single volume that brings together keen analyses of the expressive arts of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan. The Road Less Traveled is the first book of its kind. It brings together in the same volume essays on the literatures of the Horn of Africa written by renowned regional and international scholars. All the countries in the region, their major writers, and the genres through which the people in the Horn express themselves are given careful attention. The volume also includes essays that traverse borders, and/or transgress generic delineations/delimitations. The essays in the volume attest to a simple fact, namely, that through the arts humans weave a labyrinthine system of symbolic representations that bear witness to lives lived or imagined. And while in the Horn of Africa catastrophes may abound, the calamity that besets this region can equally be explained through its antiphony: the perseverance and cosmic, albeit cautious, optimism of its people. A horn, after all, is also a way of making music.',
